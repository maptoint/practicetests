         	Which three statements are true?

            1. The default constructor initialises method variables.

            2. The default constructor has the same access as its class.

            3. The default constructor invokes the no-arg constructor of the superclass.

            4. If a class lacks a no-arg constructor, the compiler always creates a default constructor.

            5. The compiler creates a default constructor only when there are no other constructors for the class.



            A. 1, 2 and 4

            B. 2, 3 and 5

            C. 3, 4 and 5

            D. 1, 2 and 3
